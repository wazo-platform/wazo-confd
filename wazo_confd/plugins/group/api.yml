            Ignore forwarding from member endpoints;

            this only affects forwarding configured directly on member endpoint devices;
            this _does not_ affect the forwardings configured through user profiles, 
            nor the fallback redirections configured on the group itself.
            
            When set to `true`, redirections from member endpoints are ignored and skipped,
            and other members are rung according to the ring strategy;
            when `false`, redirections from members' endpoints are followed,
            which effectively answers the call to the group.
